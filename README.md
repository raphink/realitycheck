# 🕵️‍♂️ RealityCheck

RealityCheck is a lightweight web app designed to help tweens and teens develop critical thinking skills in the age of social media. It presents users with posts that look like they came from popular platforms—then challenges them to decide whether the content is true or false.

After each decision, users get an explanation and a score, encouraging curiosity, reflection, and better digital literacy.
